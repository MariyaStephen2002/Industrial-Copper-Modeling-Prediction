# Industrial-Copper-Modeling-Prediction
This project seeks to create machine learning model tailored for the copper industry, with the primary goal of addressing the difficulties associated with predicting selling prices and classifying leads. Manual predictions can be both time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies, making it challenging to make optimal pricing decisions or correctly identify leads. The proposed models will incorporate advanced techniques, including data normalization, outlier detection and treatment, addressing data format issues, exploring feature distributions, and harnessing tree-based models to achieve precise predictions for both selling prices and lead classification.
